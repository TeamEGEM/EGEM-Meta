Official EtherGem Project Description

EGEM is the stable pure no pre mine coin with applied technologies peernet and per block endowment

What does that really mean, though?

EtherGem, "EGEM," is a pure community-based coin with no pre mine. True to its roots as a cryptocurrency, the Proof of Work mining community will always be a part of the EGEM future and is the foundation of the EGEM launch. There is no ICO on EGEM and EGEM is its own primary blockchain, not just a token or concept on another chain. The EtherGem blockchain is an ethereum network, meaning it starts with the tested and proven ethereum (as in ETH) core technologies and builds from there. Technically EGEM is a Ethereum chain as described in the yellow paper, with EIP150, EIP155, EIP158 applied from block 0. Block Rewards have 3 Eras of reduction, including a dev reward enabled after block 5000. Developers and Community Managers are bound by a continuity agreement to maintain the network, community, and coin. There is no cap to EGEM at the moment. A monetary cap will be put in place when the community determines that a logical progression would be to cap the coin.

An "applied technologies peernet" is where the EtherGem blockchain grows on a mineable token sidechain. Dual mining ethergem and a token on claymore is something new. The EGEM sidechain is designed to be very much an integral part of ongoing mainchain development where peers can implement new technology while continuing to rely on a solid foundation. The sidechain and token will be available shortly after the mainnet release.
